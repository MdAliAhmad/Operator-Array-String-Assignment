Operator, Array, String Assignment

1. List the operators in java?
-Increment and Decrement operator.
-relational operators.
-equality operators.
-arithmetic operators.
-instance of operator.
-bitwise operators.
-shortcircuit operators.
-typecast operators.
-assignment operators.
-conditional operators.
-[] operator.
-precedence operator.
-evaluation of java operators.

2.Explain about incremental and decremental operators and give an example.
Increment and Decrement operators in java is use to increase or decrease the value by 1.
In the incremental operators ++ is use to increase the existing variable by 1 i.e. i=i+1.
whereas the decremental operator  -- is use to decrease the current  value by 1 i.e. i=i-1.

3.What are conditional operators in java?
We have  three types of conditional operators-
-logical and
-logical or
-ternary operator

4.What are the types of operators based on the number of operands?
there are three types:-
-unary operator
-binary operator
-ternary operator

5.What are the conditional statements and use of conditional statement in java?
 ->if-it is use to  specify a block of code to be executed,if  a specified condition is true.
 ->else-it is use to specify the block of code to be executed if the same condition is false.
 ->else if-it is use to specify a new condition to test,if the first condition is false.
 ->switch-it is use to specify many alternative block of code to be executed.

6.Write the syntax of if else statement?
 if(con 1){
 
 }
 else if(con 2){
 
 }
 else{

 }

7.What are the 3 types of iterative statements in java?
-for loop
-while loop
-do-while loop

8.What do you mean by an array?
Array is a index collection of fixed no of homogenous data elements.Its size is fixed and can not be changed.

9.How to create an Array?
-Initialize and construction the array 
-Array declarations

10.State the  difference  between StringBuffer and StringBuilder in java?
The main difference between StringBuffer and StringBuilder in Java is that StringBuffer is thread-safe (synchronized), whereas StringBuilder is not, resulting in potential performance differences in multi-threaded and single-threaded environments, respectively.
